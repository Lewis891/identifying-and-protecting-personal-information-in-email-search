Previous approaches for classifying Sensitive Data - 
previous software used dictionaries to term-match known sensitive terms and regular expressions.
word list based systems are costly, time consuming and fragile. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is more popular, is a supervised machine learning process
Entity generalisation - converts entities to less specific forms, IBM becomes computer based company. retains
more of a documents utility.
